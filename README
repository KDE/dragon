INTRODUCTION
  Codeine is a very simple xine-based media player.

  I make the following promises:

    * I will not add any substantial features after version 1.0.0
    * After then, improvements will only be in the realm of usability and bug
      fixes

  You can rely on Codeine for now and until xine is obsolete to be a simple
  no-frills video(/media) player.

  Visit #codeine on freenode.net!

REQUIREMENTS
  You will need at least:

    * Qt 3.3.0 (Qt 3.2.x may work, it is just not tested)
    * KDElibs 3.3.0
    * xine-lib 1.0.0-rc4

  You also need python installed in order to build Codeine.


INSTALLATION
  I use scons + bksys as the build system. But you can still do the following:

     % ./configure && make && su -c "make install"

  Or if you have scons installed, simply:

     % scons && su -c "scons install"

  Note that scons is a little silly and this kind of thing doesn't work:

     % ./configure --prefix=/foo/bar --debug=full

  Instead do:

     % ./configure prefix=/foo/bar debug=full


TRANSLATIONS
  I will make the po file available for translation at the 1.0-rc1 stage, if
  you want to make a translation I thank you in advance :-)
