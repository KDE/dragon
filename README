INTRODUCTION
  Dragon Player is a very simple Phonon-based media player. It was originally 
  developed by Max Howell and called Codeine. I ported it to KDE 4.0 and on 
  Max's suggestion renamed it to Video Player (probably, I might still
  rename it.)  

  Similar to Max, I make the following promises:

    * I will not add any substantial features after version 2.0.0
    * After then, improvements will only be in the realm of usability, bug
      fixes, portability and allowing users to play their media.

  The aim of Dragon Player is to "just play my video." Precedence will be given
  to short simple menus and being configuration-free over additional features.
 
  If you do have bugs, feature requests or (even better) features you want 
  removed, you can usually catch me in #amarok on irc.kde.org using a variation
  of the nick eean.

  Thanks!
