1.0.1
   Volume state saving

1.0.x
   Improve error messages and error handling
   Consolidate error handling code in part and application so we don't diverge
   No audio icon in analyzer when no audio
   Playback finished message (amaroK statusbar code?)
   Mouse move to show toolbar in fullscreen mode
   People are likely to use "F" keyboard shortcut or escape after film ends in fullscreen mode
      but the popup of the menu prevents this, as for some reason Qt stops handling keyboard
      shortcuts. We need a solution. The escape issue makes the popup menu less useful. So
      escape with the menu should exit fullscreen too. All shortcuts in the menu should work.
      Shortcuts not in the menu shouldn't work as this is a modal menu! Could be dangerous.
   Consider adding quit to the fullscreen context menu always, or make the menubar show with
      toolbar when mouse moves.
   Add tooltips to PlayMedia dialog for recent file listview entries (directory info etc.)
   Show zoom percentage in statusbar/OSD when resizing window, snap to 100%?
   More feedback at playback end
   Better loading/buffering status/feedback
   Save prettyTitle with url and show that in recent file list,
      - save m3u's? <-- needs thought
      - mark remote files?
   Support .srt files like Kaffeine/xine-ui does, ask berkus if stuck.
   DVD fullscreen, DVD menu shows or something

1.1
   Volume button (not there by default)
   Two entries in Konqueror: 1. open in new window 2. open in current window
   Play from begin scroll up popup when resuming playback
   Much better DVD support
   Show length information in normal window
   'o' in fullscreen mode shows OSD of length and elapsed time info, <-- emulate mplayer

ACTION
   xine config dialog is modal
REACTION
   none, at least yet, it is far easier to maintain modal dialogs
