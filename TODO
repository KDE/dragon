Version 2.1+

_Certainly_:
*external subtitle support
*'o' in fullscreen mode shows OSD of length and elapsed time info, <-- emulate mplayer
*indiciate remote media somehow in PlayDialog
*DBus interface, subset of the VideoLAN Dbus API
*resume DVD playback, probably requires remembering chapter and stuff which might need 
more Phonon API

_Thoughts_:
*PlayDialog optimization
    *show an icon in the previously played list, indicating whether its audio or video. 
    *allow filtering by audio/video? too confusing?
*improve volume control if needed
    *Chapter skipping, menu button
*More feedback at playback end
        ->Playback finished message (amaroK statusbar code?)
*refactor: get rid of Engine::Status, just use Phonon's status
*use libkcddb, have the videoWindow display list of tracks in audio cd and highlight currently playing song. Have a button for the "edit cd" libkcddb dialog.
->something similar for pls/m3u files?

_Probably Not_:
*live previews of previously played videos


Before 2.0-rc1:
*add all the basic features to the KPart (done)
*Audio channel selection (done?)
*hide the videowidget when playing audio (done)
*have a volume somehow (done)
*app wide volume state saving (done)
*accurate file filter for open file dialog (ask Vir)
*fix: status bar looses title on resize
*test the PLS code
*audio channel and subtitles...
	*record their setting for between sessions
        *subtitles needs an "off" option
        *does audio need an "auto" or is that the same as the first option?
*test VCDs, audio CDs
