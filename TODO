Version 2.1+

_Certainly_:
*external subtitle support
*'o' in fullscreen mode shows OSD of length and elapsed time info, <-- emulate mplayer
*indiciate remote media somehow in PlayDialog
*DBus interface, subset of the VideoLAN Dbus API (done)
*resume DVD playback, probably requires remembering chapter and stuff which might need 
more Phonon API
*Look into using LiveConnectExtension to provide a WMP or RealPlayer-like 
JavaScript interface for the kpart. KMplayer apparently does this.

_Thoughts_:
*a movie-like rolling credits instead of the about dialog
*PlayDialog optimization
    *show an icon in the previously played list, indicating whether its audio or video. (done)
    *allow filtering by audio/video? too confusing?
*improve volume control if needed
*Chapter skipping
*More feedback at playback end
        ->Playback finished message (amaroK statusbar code?)
*refactor: get rid of Engine::Status, just use Phonon's status
*use libkcddb, have the videoWindow display list of tracks in audio cd and highlight currently playing song. Have a button for the "edit cd" libkcddb dialog.
->something similar for pls/m3u files? people would probably want to edit the playlist then...

_Probably Not_:
*live previews of previously played videos


Before 2.0-rc1:
*add all the basic features to the KPart (done)
*Audio channel selection (done?)
*hide the videowidget when playing audio (done)
*have a volume somehow (done)
*app wide volume state saving (done)
*accurate file filter for open file dialog (ask Vir)
*fix: status bar looses title on resize (fixed)
*test the PLS code
*audio channel and subtitles...
	*record their setting for between sessions (done?)
        *subtitles needs an "off" option (done)
        *does audio need an "auto" or is that the same as the first option? (not same, still confusing)
                  the deal is that "auto" for both subtitle and audio channel means what is picked by the user in the DVD menu
                  If the user picks something in the DVD menu, this does not change what xine says the subtitle or audio
                  channel is. This sucks!
*test VCDs, audio CDs -> add Solid magic, test with two drives
*turn off screensaver when something is playing (done? testing needed)
*crash on Stop, then playing the same track (fixed)
*figure out what the volume value means in Phonon, adapt setVolume and volume DBus methods to be 0-100 range.
*if a track ends and the user clicks play, they get the play media dialog again instead of it re-playing. (fixed)
*pause/unpause restarts (fixed)
